# **Stable Soup Prompts** - Prompt Terminology Generator

I took the fantastic work by MisterRuffian and WASasquatch and converted their carefully curated .json file to a bunch of text files.
Compatible with [https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompting](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompting) wildcards script.

## Installation

- Follow the instrucitons to install the [dynamic prompting extension](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts) by adieyal.
- Download this repo by clicking the green 'code' button at the top and select download as zip
- Place the wildcards folder in the `extensions/dynamic-prompts/wildcards` folder
- If you have SD currently running you might have to restart it

## Use

- If you have followed the installation instructions you should be able to select "Dynamic Prompting" in the Scripts sections of the txt2img and img2img tabs
- To invoke a wildcard, you need to encapsulate the name of the \[wildcard\].txt you want to use in double \_\_underscores\_\_
  - For example `__adj-beauty__ __gender__ with __hair__, __fantasy-setting__, by __artist__`
- Dynamic Prompting has a lot more functionality beyond wildcards, so I recommend you check out the [README](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompting/blob/main/README.md) for that script.
